# Minecraft Plugin Archive

From 2012 to 2019, I built many, many Minecraft plugins for servers. Some were contracted (and, therefore, aren't included here) but most were either private plugins or plugins for the public.
Two of these plugins, Innovative Mechanics and Dominions, I actually sold as premium plugins for about $5. Made a couple thousand dollars back in high school from those! I also still have some plugins up for download on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/quzzar.447691/).

I might go back and rework some of these one day, plugin development is a lot of fun!
